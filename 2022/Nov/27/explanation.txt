# Add Binary Strings


How to Approach: 

Here,we have to add two binary number concerning about the fact that the result should not have leading zeros.
Clearly,the binary number can be of different size.
So,let us first make both string of equal length by placing leading zeros.[As,leading zeros will not affect the sum]
Now one can recall from Digital Electronics that in Full Adder,
Sum bits = Xoring of ( A xor B xor Cin)[ Cin: Carry in]
And, Cout[carry out] = ((A xor B) and Cin) or (A and B)
Use this logic to make out addition for each bits.
How to Code:

First make out each Binary number of equal length.
Iterate the number from last index and generating the Sum bits and inserting in the list.
On the end of iteration,make sure whether carry at end is still 0 else,append 1 at the end.
Since answer(result) should not contain leading zeros,pop out all such zeros until 1.
Finally return string in reverse manner(as,we gonna having our calculation in reverse order).
