Explanation

How to take Approach:

Here in this question we have to find the maximum Sum of discrete unique number whose LCM equals the number itself N.
Now, problem arises that how to find such list of numbers whose sum out to be maximum.
Now,we left out with clue that LCM of such number must be equals to N.
Thus,think what might LCM is; the lowest common multiple it means something is related to factor of number itself.
Let us take an example,N = 201.Then factor are: 1,3,67,201.
Now,here taking the number itself i.e., 201 and others give out LCM equals 201.
Thus, to find out maximum sum just take out sum of all factors.

How to write Code:

Now to find the set of all factors just iterate over the number upto sqrt(n) and check whether it is divisible by N.
Care should be taken that number should not be repeated during addition.
So,take care during adding for perfect square number.
