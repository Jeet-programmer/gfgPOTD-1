Explanation: [ You can take example to watch the pattern]

Why to return "square root of N"(floor).
Every number upto N,which is perfect square will remains open at end.
Thus,for N number of gate,the maximum possible numberof open gate will floor(math.sqrt(N)) whose each square will be open.
For example, for N = 10, gate number 1,4,9[all are perfect square] will remain open at end.
Thus, total 3 gate will open at end.
Now, the question arises why only perfect square will remain at ends.

Note: Only perfect square number have total odd factor.

Thus,closed gate will become open.

 

Check out pattern:

 

1: 1[odd]

2: 1,2

3: 1,3

4: 1,2,4[odd]

5: 1,5

6: 1,2,3,6

...

 

9: 1,3,9[odd]

...

 

16:1,2,4,8,16[odd]

Thus, we are interested to count all such number which are perfect square.
