Explanation:

1. If N is not divisible by 2,then definitely N and N-2 will be also not divisible by 2. [N-1 will be divisible by 2 leaving no common divisor]
2. Thus, LCM will likely be (N)*(N-1)*(N-2)
3. else, if N is divisble by 2 and 3 too, in this case N and N-3 have common element 3 and N and N-2 have common 2,So it is better to return (N-1)*(N-2)*(N-3).
4. In other case even if N is divisible by 2 only not 3,then better to go with (N)*(N-1)*(N-3).As,N>N-2 comparing previous LCM.
5. Above all case for small value of N i.e., N<=3.As, 1 and 3 have same factor 3 for N =3 and similarly for other N; N<=3.
6. Therefore, do not forget to put this base term.
7. For larger value of remember no any 3 consecutive number have divisor other than 2 or 3 mentioning above conditions.
