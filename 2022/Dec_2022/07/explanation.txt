How to Approach: 

Here we have to find the Kth smallest Element in the given BST having O(1) extra space.
Now, clearly we know that inOrder traverse will give out sorted data in BST.
Thus, made out Inorder traversal while taking a counter to manage for value of k.
Now,if we reach out that specific Kth element.Store it out and return it.
Make sure that default value to be returned to be -1 so that we will return -1 in the case when the K is greater than total element being present in BST.
