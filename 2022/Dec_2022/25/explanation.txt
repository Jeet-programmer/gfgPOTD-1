How to Approach: 

TC: O(n^2)

SC: O(1)

Here we have to find whether it is possible to replace the single 0 in the given matrix with a positive integer such that sum of series from either row,col,diagonal(left to right and right to left) must be equal.If this is not possible return -1
If the condition goes satisfied return that possible number.
Now question arises, how to approach clearly it is given sum along all the possible region is same.
So, first find the index for 0 in the matrix.
Then, find the sum SumCount of one of the row or column[that special zero should not be included in this]
Then iterate through the column/row contain that special zero to get sum,Sumreq = SumCount-(sum of this series).
Now update the special zero with Sumreq.
Finally check whether the new updated matrix is valid.
If valid return sumReq(if sumReq>0) else -1.
