TC: O(M+N) 

SC: O(1)

How to Approach:

Here, we have to find whether the string can be modified as per given condition so it can become replica of the other.
Clearly, no character can cross each other, this means that the string willl only replicate in the case when, the alphabet are present in both string in same order(with numbers).
Now create two index one for each to match the presence of alphabet in both string in same order.
Increase the index only when we found "#" otherwise wait for other one to match the alphabet.
If alphabet matches then pass on otherwise return 0 immediately.
At last return 1 if while terminate indicating all alphabet matches.
Must ensure that to count the length and letters in each to escape index error.
Note: Here, we have to solve in O(1) space Complexity.
