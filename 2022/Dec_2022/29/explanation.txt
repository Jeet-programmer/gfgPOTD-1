# TC: O(N); SC: O(N)

How to Approach: 

TC(avg) : O(N); SC:O(N)[you can even optimize to O(1) if implement popping out inf element directly]

Here let us first recapitulate question and lthen let us implement mine one of the favourite logic  through this question.
Here according to question, we are given an array such that each index contains asteroids of certain value which move right[if positive value] else go for left.
Now there is one more thing that during travelling when two asteroids collide,then lighter one explodes away.If both are having same magnitude both one faces explosion.
Now, lets began implementation and logical part,let us first start with index 0 and check using while loop iterating leftwards such that if asteroids having lower magnitude or same magnitude comparing to asteroids[i] will turns out to float('inf')[means explodes away].Move towards left only if asteroids[i]<0.
Moving Left at given index i will ends through while loop only when (either low<0 or both asteroids[i] and asteroids[low] are unidirectional).
Similarly at same index i move towards right using while looping keeping the criteria of collision in mind such move towards right only when asteroids[i]>0.
Note: Keep in mind that loop will terminates through break statement if there is not furthur collision and asteroids are moving unidirectional.
