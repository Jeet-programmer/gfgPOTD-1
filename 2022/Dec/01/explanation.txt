How to Approach:

Got this idea/code from one of its comments,but did not find any suitable explanation for this logic implementation.
Let me explain, Here we have to update the array with O(1) space complexity; updating the alternatively, largest and smallest from left to right.
So, now suppose we goes updating the elements with index 0,2,4,6, and so on with index -1,-2,-3 ,,, and so on[negative index means approaching from right side]
But this will loss the identity of original number which will furthur to be used to updated the odd index number.
Therefore, we can update number like that its floor division gives updated number and remainder gives original number.
Note: arr[i] += (arr[end]%max_)*max_

Here, the floor division of arr[i] will gives updated number while remainder gives old/original number.
