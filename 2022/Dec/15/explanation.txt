This is a beautiful question dedicated to all toddler in GFG.
Now, in this question we have to play with string,ASCII code and If-else statement.
First create an empty list to store all alphabet for N<=26.
Going through the question, when N is divisible by 2,then store the alphabet from from ASCII value 97 upto N//2 terms and then add on N//2 elements in reverse manner from 122 ASCII values( from 'z').
Similarly, when N is odd,we have given two conditions whether the sum of digits are odd or even and condition following it from string arrangement.
The odd part can be solved similarly to Even subpart.
Just go throughout the question takes your time and solve it.
Note: You can calculate sum of digits of N by dividing and calculating the remainder using while loop.
