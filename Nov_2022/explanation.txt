Approach:

1. After reading the question, one can wonder if what is this anagrams.
2. So, basically two set of letters are called to anagrams if another one created by jumbling the other.
3. Now,how one can check whether two binary tree are anagrams two each other in traversal.
4. So,basically coders can go for creating hashmap with key as order level of tree and keeping value as the number given in the tree at each level.
5. After finding the both hashmap,just iterate over it and sort out the data to comparing the both value of each key.
6. If all comparison goes well return 1 else return 0
