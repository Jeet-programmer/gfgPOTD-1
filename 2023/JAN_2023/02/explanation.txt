How to Approach: 

[DFS+BFS Implementation]  [TC: O(N); SC: O(H) ]

1) DFS 

Let us start with explaining question, here we have to find the maximum value at each level of tree.
For DFS where we traverse depthwise,initialise a dictionary to store the maximum value where key denote the level of the tree and its value will record the maximum value.
Just make your DFS iteration and got your result.
Note: Just make out Level order Traversal and store the maximum values at each level.


2) BFS

Again like DFS implementation, implement Level order Traversal using Queue.
Find the maximum values at each level storing the max in the array.
Finally return that array.
